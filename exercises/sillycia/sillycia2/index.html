            >LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</br>
                <br>
            According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.<br><br>
            CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: <br>
           <br> * the Cold War<br>
            * the civil-rights movement <br>
            * the growth of the international drug trade <br>
